* About you and me

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Lifetime posessors experts in HCI
  - **H** uman
  - **C** ommunicative
  - **I** ntelligence

- Human GPTs!
  - **G** enerative
  - **P** retrained
  - **T** ransformer

- That is to say we are **REALLY REALLY GOOD** at communication!

  
* /Once upon a time there was a/...

* /Today's talk is brought to you by the letter G/...

* /On your mark, get/...

** Two countries separated by a common language

- /On your *mark*, get set, go!/ (USA)
- /On your *marks*, get set, go!/ (UK)

[[./img/GBS.jpeg]]

* /Dearly beloved we/...

* /The concept dates back at least to/... 

* /Eggs, milk,/...

* Recognizing words in context and their associations

- A large part of our COMMUNICATIVE INTELLIGENCE

- We learn these patterns over time as we are exposed to language across context

- And we reproduce and extend them when we come to communicate


* Quick Overview: What is a GPT?

- **G** enerative
- **P** retrained
- **T** ransformer

** Quick Overview: What is a GPT?

- Why is it important to understand something about how they work?

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[./img/car.jpg]]

- We drive cars and most of us have little to no understanding of how they work
- And we don't need to in order to drive

** Quick Overview: What is a GPT?

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[./img/car.jpg]]

- **BUT**... no one is claiming that cars are sentient, intelligent, self-determining, etc.

- If they did, having an understanding of the mechanics of a car would
  allow you to refute or strongly question these claims

** Quick Overview: What is a GPT?
  
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- A **MACHINE LEARNING** model
- Specifically using **deep learning** (DL) version of a **NEURAL NETWORK**
- In the past few years has become **THE** predominate kind of DL
  model and taken over the field of *Artificial Intelligence* (AI)


** Machine Learning

- Using (large) amount of data to solve problems instead of using
  human constructed rules and procedures (traditional programming)

  
- Find **FEATURES** in image that are most helpful in distinguishing
  - between cat and dog
  - or a Bulldog and a German shepherd

** Machine Learning

- For example, /What kind of dog is Rufus?/

** Neural Network

- A general purpose ML model with interconnected nodes/neurons arranged in layers that
  process input signals and pass them on to other nodes/neurons

  
- A deep neural network has multiple layers (or stages) between the INPUT and OUTPUT
  - Through repeated exposure to data different features captured across layers
  - Best features are discovered

** Neural Network

*** Cat or dog?

- Try a cat/dog classifier

*** What kind of dog (or cat)?

- Try a pet breed classifier

** Transformer
